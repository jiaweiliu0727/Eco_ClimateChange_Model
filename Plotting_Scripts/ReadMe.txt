## This directory includes code to plot the model output into maps and a summary figure (figs. 1-5 in the main text).
## Code written and maintained by : Jiawei Liu (liu3594@purdue.edu)
## The required packages and files are indicated in each R script.
## Sample model output files are provided after removing the locations with no historical defoliation. The related steps are described in Supplemental Information. Defoliation data and detailed model output processing methods are available upon request.
## For reproducing Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, here we give an example of initial insect density=25 larvae/m^2, which equals to 1000 egg masses/ha. The maps under other insect densities can be generated similarly.
