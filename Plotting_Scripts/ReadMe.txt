## This directory includes code to plot the model output into maps and a summary figure (figs. 1-5 in the main text).
## Code written and maintained by : Jiawei Liu (liu3594@purdue.edu)
## The required packages and files are indicated in each R script.
## Sample model output files are provided after removing the locations with no historical defoliation. The related steps are described in Supplemental Information. Defoliation data and detailed model output processing methods are available upon request.
## One file indicating map boundaries of USA and Canada is zipped into .rar file (usacan_gmregion) because of github file size limitation. Upzip it before running the R scripts.
## For reproducing Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, here we give an example of initial insect density=25 larvae/m^2, which equals to 1000 egg masses/ha. The maps under other insect densities can be generated similarly.
## Extended figs. 2 and 5 can be made by using similar code as that for fig. 1, with the projected weather data under different climate change scenarios.
## Extended figs. 3 and 6 can be made by using similar code as that for fig. 2, with model projections of fraction infected generated by inserting weather data under different climate change scenarios.
## Extended figs. 4 and 7 can be made by using similar code as that for fig. 4, with defoliation projections generated by inserting weather data under different climate change scenarios.
